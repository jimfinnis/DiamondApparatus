Clearly an obvious speedup is to make the topics use integer ids
in all messages, so..

CS_SUBSCRIBE takes a string, but is responded to with an ack containing
the ID for the topic (the server will allocate one for each new topic).
The client has its own map of ids->names. subscribe() on the client
side returns the id, so a waitany loop might go

    int idFoo = subscribe("foo");
    Topic t = get(GET_WAITANY);
    if(t.id == idFoo){
        ...
    }

SC_NOTIFY will contain the ID of the topic.
